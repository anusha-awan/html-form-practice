# My HTML Form Project

This project is a basic HTML form page created as part of my web development learning journey.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure with header, main, and footer
- Various form input types: text, password, email, phone, date, radio buttons, checkboxes, file upload, and textarea
- Form validation using HTML5 attributes like `required`, `minlength`, and `pattern`
- Navigation links included for related resources

## About Me

Created by Anusha Awan during my early web development practice.  
Looking forward to improving and adding CSS styling next!
