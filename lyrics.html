        Maybe it's the way you say my name
    Maybe it's the way you play your game
    But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
    But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
    
    And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
    And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
    
    'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    And I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
    
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
    I think that you are the one for me
    
    'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy
    And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
    And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
    
    'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    And I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
    
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    All of the time
    
    Dandelion, into the wind you go
    Won't you let my darling know?
    Dandelion, into the wind you go
    Won't you let my darling know that?
    I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    
    And I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
    I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
